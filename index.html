	<h2>Help Naruto get some ramen!

	<div class="history">
		<br><h3>Believe it!</h3>
				This is Naruto. He might be known as the village troublemaker but he is certainly no fool when it comes to ramen. Consuming roughly 10 bowls per sitting, this kid can eat. Today, Naruto is feeling like consuming some Tonkotsu Ramen, like straight up 10 bowls of it, and nothing else. Let's see if we can help him order the ramen he desires.

		<br><h3>Kinds of Ramen</h3>
			If you've been around since the start of the semester, you should recall that ramen comes in all shapes and sizes. At Naruto's favourite ramen shop, there are 3 types of ramen from which he can choose!

				<p>These types of ramen include:
			<ul>
		  			<li><i>Shio</i> - A <b>salt-based</b> ramen. This is the most simple flavour type. You could consider any western soup broth to be of the Shio Variety. </li>
			  		<p><li><i>Miso</i> - A <b>miso-based</b> ramen. In this type, miso paste is used to flavour the broth. </li>
			  		<p><li><i>Tonkotsu</i> - A <b>pork-based</b> ramen. In this ramen, ground pork bones are boiled to create the broth. Experts spend upwards of 15 hours perfecting this technique. Yum! </li>
